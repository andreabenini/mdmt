# Project TODOs
This is not a never finished project, something has to work and something else will be added
on upcoming releases (maybe). Here are planned features, wishlists, requirements and improvements.
Some of them might see the light in upcoming releases, few will remain here for some time. Feel
free to fund the project if you want to add your favorite feature or contribute if possible.  
Here's current wishlist
- code block color rendering. It's already working but a better formatted (and colored) output
is preferred.
- code block CSS support. As a programmer I usually add a lot of code blocks, basic CSS is not enough.

Please add your pull requests or file an issue for your favorite features, each single feature
has to be fully MarkDown compatible, no extra custom features will be added. Use TeX instead.
