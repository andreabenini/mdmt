# Project TODOs
- code block color rendering. It's already working but a better formatted (and colored) output
is preferred.
- code block CSS support. As a programmer I usually add a lot of code blocks, basic CSS is not enough.
- `mermaid` support. I'm an heavy user of Mermaid code blocks so a good renderer is something I need.
It's now working on HTML output pages only, it's still missing from pdf output

Please add your pull requests or file an issue for your favorite features, each single feature
has to be fully MarkDown compatible, no extra custom features will be added. Use TeX instead.
